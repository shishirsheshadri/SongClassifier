  I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing "Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!" One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells are ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you're gone there was never Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king?

  Sha, sha, sha I probably shouldn't say this But at times I get so scared When I think about the previous Relationship we shared It was awesome, but we lost it It's not possible for me not to care And now we're standing in the rain But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear My dear The seven things I hate about you The seven things I hate about you Oh, you You're vain, your games, you're insecure You love me, you like her You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts I wanna be with the one I know And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do You make me love you It's awkward and it's silent As I wait for you to say But what I need to hear now your sincere apology When you mean it, I'll believe it If you text it I'll delete it Let's be clear Oh, I'm not coming back You're taking seven steps here The seven things I hate about you You're vain, your games, you're insecure You love me, you like her You made me laugh, you made me cry, I don't know which side to buy Your friends, they're jerks, and when you act like them, just know it hurts I wanna be with the one I know And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do You make me love you Compared to all the great things That would take too long to write I probably should mention The seven that I like The seven things I like about you Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's When we kiss, I'm hypnotized You made me laugh, you made me cry, but I guess that's both that I'll have to buy Your hand in mine when we're intertwined, everything's alright I wanna be with the one I know And the seventh thing I like the most that you do You make me love you Sha, sha, you do, oh 
  She was staring out the window of that SUV Complaining, saying "I can't wait to turn eighteen" She said "I'll make my own money, and I'll make my own rules" Momma put the car in park out there in front of the school She kissed her head and said "I was just like you" You're gonna miss this You're gonna want this back You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast These are some good times So take a good look around You may not know it now But you're gonna miss this Before she knows it she's a brand new bride In her one-bedroom apartment, and her daddy stops by He tells her "It's a nice place" She says "It'll do for now" Starts talking about babies and buying a house Daddy shakes his head and says "Baby, just slow down" You're gonna miss this You're gonna want this back You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast These are some good times So take a good look around You may not know it now But you're gonna miss this Five years later there's a plumber workin' on the water heater Dog's barkin', phone's ringin' One kid's cryin', one kid's screamin' She keeps apologizin' He says "They don't bother me I've got two babies of my own One's thirty six, one's twenty three Huh, it's hard to believe, but You're gonna miss this You're gonna want this back You're gonna wish these days hadn't gone by so fast These are some good times So take a good look around You may not know it now But you're gonna miss this You're gonna' miss this Yeah You're gonna' miss this 
  A thousand times I've seen you standing Gravity like lunar landing You make me wanna run till I find you I shut the world away from here Drift to you, you're all I hear As everything we know fades to black Half the time the world is ending Truth is I am done pretending I, never thought that I Had anymore to give You're pushing me so far Here I am without you Drink, to all that we have lost Mistakes we have made Everything will change But, love remains the same Find a place where we escape Take you with me for a space The city bus sounds just like a fridge I walk the streets through seven bars I have to find just where you are The faces seem to blur They're all the same Half the time the world is ending Truth is I am done pretending I, never thought that I Had anymore to give You're pushing me so far Here I am without you Drink, to all that we have lost Mistakes we have made Everything will change But, love remains the same So much more to say So much to be done Don't you trick me now We shall overcome So all that's left is praying But we, should have had the sun We could have been inside Instead we're over here Half the time the world is ending Truth is I am done pretending Too much time too long defending You and I are done pretending I, never thought that I Had anymore to give You're pushing me so far Here I am without you Drink, to all that we have lost Mistakes we have made Everything will change Everything will change I, oh I, I wish this could last forever I, oh I, as if we could last forever Love remains the same Love remains the same

  Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell It was love from above, like it saved me from hell She had fire in her soul, it was easy to see how the devil himself could be pulled out of me There were drums in the air as she started to dance Every soul in the room keeping time with their hands and we sang Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay And the voices rang like the angels sing We're singing, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay And we danced on into the night Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh And we danced on into the night Like a piece to the puzzle that falls into place You could tell how we felt from the look on her face She was spinning in circles with the moon in her eyes The room left them moving between you and I We forgot where we were, and we lost track of time And we sang to the wind as we danced through the night, and we sang Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay And the voices rang like the angels sing We're singing, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay And we danced on into the night Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh And we danced on into the night And we danced on into the night Like a gift from the heavens, it was easy to tell It was love from above, like it saved me from hell She had fire in her soul it was easy to see How the devil himself could be pulled out of me There were drums in the air as she started to dance Every soul in the room keeping time with there hands, and we sang Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay, and the voices rang like the angels sing We're singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay And we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh And we danced on into the night (And the voices rang like the angels sing) Ay oh ay oh, ay oh ay oh, and we danced on into the night, ay oh ay oh ay oh ay (Ay oh ay oh) Ay oh ay oh ay oh ay (Ay oh ay oh) Singing ay oh ay oh ay oh ay (Ay oh ay oh) And we danced on into the night
