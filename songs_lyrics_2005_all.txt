  I know there's something in the wake of your smile. I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yea. You've built a love but that love falls apart. Your little piece of heaven turns too dark. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile. The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yea. They're swept away and nothing is what is seems, The feeling of belonging to your dreams. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. And there are voices that want to be heard. So much to mention but you can't find the words. The sense of magic, the beauty that's been When love was wilder than the wind. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye. Listen to your heart when he's calling for you. Listen to your heart there's nothing else you can do. I don't know where you're going and I don't know why, But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye.

'Cause your drowning in the water And I tried to grab your hand And I left my heart open But you didn't understand But you didn't understand You fix yourself I can't help you fix yourself But at least I can say I tried I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life I can't help you fix yourself But at least I can say I tried I'm sorry but I gotta move on with my own life I tear my heart open I sew myself shut My weakness is that I care too much Our scars remind us That the past is real I tear my heart Open just to feel I tear my heart open I sew myself shut My weakness is that I care too much Our scars remind us That the past is real I tear my heart open Just to feel

Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we were teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Laney were to young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdies neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)

  She said I've seen you in here before, I said I've been here a time or two, She said hello my name is Bobbi Jo Meet my twin sister Betty Lou And we're both feeling kinda wild tonight, You're the only cowboy in this place, If your up for a rodeo, I'll put a big Texas smile on your face. I said girls, I ain't as good as I once was, I got a few years on me now, But there was a time, Back in my prime, When I could really lay it down, If you need some love tonight, Then I might have just enough, I ain't as good once was, But I'm as good once, as I ever was. I still hang out with my best friend Dave, I've known him since we were kids at school. Last night he had a few shots, Got in a tight spot Hustling a game of pool, With a couple of red neck boys, And one great big fat biker man, I heard David yell across the room, Hey Buddy how bout a helping hand. I said Dave! I ain't as good as I once was, My how the years have flown, But there was a time, Back in my prime, When I could really hold my own, But if you want a fight tonight, Guess those boys don't look all that tough, I ain't as good once was, But I'm as good once, as I ever was.

  She's cold and she's cruel, but she knows what she's doing. She pushed me in the pool at our last school reunion. She's laughs about my dreams, but I dream about her laughter. Strange as it seems she's the one I'm after. ( 1, 2, 3, 4) 'Cause she's bittersweet, she knocks me off of my feet, and I can't help myself I don't want anyone else. She's a mystery, she's too much for me, but I keep coming back for more. She's just the girl I'm looking for. (Just the girl I'm looking for) (She's just the girl i'm looking for) She can't keep a secret for more than an hour. She runs on one hundred proof attitude power, and the more she ignores me the more I adore her. What can I do? I'd do anything for her. (1, 2, 3, 4) 'Cause she's bittersweet, she knocks me off of my feet, and I can't help myself I don't want anyone else. She's a mystery, she's too much for me, but I keep coming back for more. She's just the girl I'm looking for. And when she sees it's me, on her caller ID, she won't pick up the phone, she'd rather be alone. But I can't give up just yet, 'cause every word she's ever said, is still ringing in my head. Is still ringing in my head. She's cold and she's cruel but she knows what she's doing. Knows just what to say, so my whole day is ruined. 'Cause she's bittersweet, she knocks me off of my feet, and I can't help myself I don't want anyone else. She's a mystery, she's too much for me, but I keep coming back for more. 'Cause she's bittersweet, she knocks me off of my feet, and I can't help myself I don't want anyone else. She's a mystery, she's too much for me, but I keep coming back for more. Oh, I keep coming back for more. She's just the girl I'm looking for. Just the girl I'm looking for. Just the girl (I'm looking for) She's just the girl (I'm looking for) Just the girl (I'm looking for) Just the girl I'm looking for.

'Cause a Mississippi girl don't change her ways Just 'cause everybody knows her name Ain't big headed from a little bit of fame Still like wearing my old ball cap Riding my kids around piggy back They might know me all around this world But, y'all, I'm still a Mississippi, girl Mississippi girl! Oh oh Mississippi girl! Mississippi girl! Yeah, yeah, oh Oh oh oh oh oh Mississippi girl! Na, Na 
  I'm never goin' nowhere so don't try me My music sticks in fans veins like an IV Flows poison like Ivy, oh they grimy Already offers on my 6th album from labels tryin' to sign me Respected highly, Hi MR. O'Reilly Hope all is well, kiss the plaintiff and the wifey Drove through the window, the industry super sized me Now the girls see me and a river's what they cry me I'm on the rise, so many people despise me Got party ammunition for those tryin' to surprise me (surprise!) It's a celebration and everyone should invite me Roll with the crew or meet the bottom of our Nikes (blaow!) Explorer like Dora these swipers can't swipe me My whole aura's so mean in my white tee Nobody light-skinded reppin' harder since Ice-T You disagree, take the Tyson approach and bite me! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright) Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh) But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man) Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey) Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! Yes indeed, Ludacris I'm hotter than Nevada Ready to break the steerin' column on yo' Impala If I get caught, bail out, po'-po' I tell 'em holla In court I never show up, like Austin Powers fa-zha Father, father, and hey I love gold But can buy anything I want from the records I've sold Jacuzzi's hot, Cristal is so cold Neighbors catch contacts, from the blunts that I've rolled A pig in a blanket, a smoke and a pancake Drop albums non-stop once a year for my fans sake I crush mics until my hand breaks Then shag now and shag later 'til these women can't stand straight The Luda-meister got 'em feelin so randy I'm double-X-L so I call 'em my "Eye Candy" Brush my shoulder and I, pop my collar Cause I'm worth a million ga-zillion fa-fillion dollars Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright) Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh) But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man) Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey) Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! Causin' lyrical disasters, it's the master Make music for Mini-Me's, models and Fat Bastards These women tryin' yo get me out my Pelle Pelle They strip off my clothes and tell me, "Get in my belly!" Stay on the track, hit the ground runnin' like Flo-Jo Sent back in time and I've never lost my mojo Ladies and gentlemen ah, boys and girls Ludacris sent down to take over the whole world! Whoa! Don't slip up or get got! (Why not man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Alright) Rappers swearin' they on top! (Nuh uh, uh uh) But I'm comin' for they number one spot! (Alright man) Scheme scheme, plot plot (say what?) I'm comin' for that number one spot! (Woo, hey) Keep it goin' it won't stop! (What you doin' man?) I'm comin' for that number one spot!
