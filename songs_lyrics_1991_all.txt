Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound That only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? I can't live without Without feeling it inside Where do all the lonely hearts go? Candle in the water Drifting helplessly Hiding from the thunder Come and rescue me Driven by the hunger Of the endless dream I'm searching for the hand that I can hold I'm reaching for the arms that let me know Where do silent hearts go? Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound That only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? I can't live without Without feeling it inside Where do all the lonely hearts go? Where do all the lonely hearts go? Then one touch overcomes the silence Love still survives Two hearts needing one another Give me wings to fly Where does my heart beat now? Where is the sound That only echoes through the night? Where does my heart beat now? I can't live without Without feeling it inside I've got someone to give my heart to Feel it getting stronger and stronger And stronger And I feel inside Hearts are made to last Till the end of time"

b"  Hush now, don't you cry Wipe away the teardrop from your eye You're lying safe in bed It was all a bad dream Spinning in your head Your mind tricked you to feel the pain Of someone close to you leaving the game of life So here it is, another chance Wide awake you face the day Your dream is over... or has it just begun? There's a place I like to hide A doorway that I run through in the night Relax child, you were there But only didn't realize and you were scared It's a place where you will learn To face your fears, retrace the years And ride the whims of your mind Commanding in another world Suddenly you hear and see This magic new dimension I... will be watching over you I... am gonna help you see it through I... will protect you in the night I... am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity I can't do this Visualize your dream Record it in the present tense Put it into a permanent form If you persist in your efforts You can achieve dream control Dream control How's that then, better? Help me If you open your mind for me You won't rely on open eyes to see The walls you built within Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin Living twice at once, you learn You're safe from the pain in the dream domain A soul set free to fly A round trip journey in your head Master of illusion, can you realize Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but... I... will be watching over you I... am gonna help to see it through I... will protect you in the night I... am smiling next to you..."

Yeah, yeah Teachers told us The romans built this place They built a wall and a temple on the edge of the Empire garrison town, They lived and they died They prayed to their gods But the stone gods did not make a sound And their empire crumbled 'Til all that was left Were the stones the workmen found And all this time the river flowed In the falling light of a northern sun If i had my way I'd take a boat from the river Men go crazy in congregations But they only get better One by one One by one, by one One by one I looked out across The river today I saw a city in the fog and an old church tower Where the seagulls play Saw the sad shire horses walking home In the sodium light Saw two priests on the ferry October geese on a cold winter's night"
