  Now I don't wanna lose you But I don't wanna use you Just to have somebody by my side And I don't wanna hate you I don't wanna take you But I don't wanna be the one to cry And that don't really matter to anyone, anymore But like a fool I keep losing my place And I keep seeing you walk through that door But there's a danger in loving somebody too much And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust There's a reason why people don't stay where they are Baby sometimes love just ain't enough Now I could never change you And I don't wanna blame you Baby you don't have to take the fault Yes I may have hurt you But I did not desert you Maybe I just want to have it all It makes a sound like thunder, it makes me feel like rain And like a fool who will never see the truth I keep thinking something's gonna change But there's a danger in loving somebody too much And its sad when you know it's your heart you can't trust There's a reason why people don't stay where they are Baby sometimes love just ain't enough And there's no way home When it's late at night and you're all alone Are there things that you wanted to say And do you feel me beside you in your bed? There beside you, where I used to lay And there's a danger in loving somebody too much And it's sad when you know it's your heart they can't touch There's a reason why people don't stay who they are Baby sometimes love just ain't enough Baby sometimes love, it just ain't enough

Now I see the importance of history Why my people be in the mess that they be Many journeys to freedom made in vain My brothers on the corner playing ghetto games I ask you Lord why you enlightened me Without the enlightenment of all my folks He said 'cause I set myself on a quest for truth And you was there to quench my thirst But I am still thirsty... The Lord allowed me to drink some more He said what I am searching for Are the answers to all which are in front of me The ultimate truth started to get blurry For some strange reason it had to be It was all a dream about Tennessee Take me to another place (Home) Take me to another land (Home) Make me forget all that hurts me Let me understand your plan Oh won't you let me Won't you help me Won't you help me understand you plan? Take me home Take me home Home Take me to another place Take me home Oh you know I need to go home, yeah Headliner? I won the game of horseshoes. Now you owe me a watermelon. Let's go climb trees and skip over rocks, do like they do below the border. Hmm? Speech's hair? No it look like the roots of the tree my ancestors were hung from. But that's okay, get it, 'cuz he's down to earth. Tennessee. Tennessee, Whoo! Yeah Tennessee. Te-Tenness... Tennessee, Tennessee

  I saw you dancin' out the ocean Running fast along the sand A spirit born of earth and water Fire flying from your hands In the instant that you love someone In the second that the hammer hits Reality runs up your spine And the pieces finally fit And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Babe, you're the one There are caravans we follow Drunken nights in dark hotels When chances breathe between the silence Where sex and love no longer gel For each man in his time is Cain Until he walks along the beach And sees his future in the water A long lost heart within his reach And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Ooh babe, you're the one And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Ooh babe, you're the one And all I ever needed was the one Like freedom fields where wild horses run When stars collide like you and I No shadows block the sun You're all I've ever needed Ooh babe, you're the one

  Is it my turn to wish you were lying here. I tend to dream you when I'm not sleeping. Is it my turn to fictionalize my world. Or even imagine your emotions. Tell myself anything... Is it my turn to hold you by your hands. Tell you I love you and you not hear me... Is it my turn to totally understand. To watch you walk out of my life and not do a damn thing... If I have to give away... The feeling that I feel. If I have to sacrifice... Oh, whatever babe, whatever baby. If I have to take apart... All that I am... Is there anything that I would not do, since I'd die without you... Yeah baby since I'd die without you... since I'd die without you... Oh, I apologize for all the things I've done. But now I'm underwater and I'm drowning... Is it my turn to be the one to cry. Isn't it amazing how some things completely turn around... So take every little piece of my heart... Yeah, take every little piece of my soul... Yeah, take every little bitty piece of my mind... 'Cause if you're gone... inside... I'd die without you...

  See I was resting at the park minding my own Business as I kick up the treble tone On my radio tape player box, right Just loud enough so folks could hear it's hype, see? Outta nowhere comes a woman I'm dating Investigation maybe she was demonstrating But nevertheless I was pleased My day was going great and my soul was at ease Until a group of brothers started bugging out Drinking the 40 oz, going the nigga route Disrespecting my black queen Holding their crotches and being obscene At first I ignored them 'cause see I know their type They got drunk and got guns and they wanna fight And they see a young couple having a time that's good And their egos wanna test a brother's manhood So they came to test Speech cause of my hair-do And the loud bright colors that I wear [Boo !] I was a target 'cause I'm a fashion misfit And the outfit that I'm wearing brothers dissing it Well I stay calm and pray the niggaz leave me be But they're squeezing parts of my date's anatomy Why, Lord, do brothers have to drill me? 'Cause if I start to hit this man they'll have to kill me I am everyday people, yeah See I am everyday people, yeah I told the niggaz please let us pass, friend I said please 'cause I don't like killing Africans But he wouldn't stop and I ain't But I had to take the brother out for being rude And like I said before I was mad by then It took three or four cops to pull me off of him But that's the story y'all of a black man Acting like a nigga and get stomped by an African You see I am everyday people, yeah You see, I am everyday people 
  Silence - it ain't the kill but the thrill of the chase Same old story, same old song Only the names have changed Fair warning - I could have read your mind in time By the look in your eyes Like diamonds turning to ashes Ties frayed and missed your signs Now I can't get over you Cannot get under somebody else I close my eyes When all I see is you, you came to drain my love away But it takes nine lives till it's over All I see is you, you came to drain my life away But I got nine, I got nine lives till it's over All my supplications gone unheard Your head in my crotch has turned to a boot But you won't hear a word Salvation - I ride into nowhereand out of nowhere I'll come The twinge in your brain, the pang of regret Don't mess with no son of a gun I'm gonna get over this Gotta get under somebody else I close my eyes When all I see is you, you came to drain my love away But it takes nine lives till it's over All I see is you, you came to drain my life away But I got nine, I got nine lives till it's over

  Sometimes we make it harder than it is We'll take a perfect night And fill it up with words we don't mean Dark sides best unseen And we wonder why we're feeling this way Sometimes I wonder if we really feel the same Why we can be unkind Questioning the strongest of hearts That's when we must start Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far That's what love is for To help us through it That's what love is for Nothing else can do it Melt our defenses Bring us back to our senses Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for Sometimes I see you and you don't know I am there And I'm washed away by emotions I hold deep down inside Getting stronger with time It's living through the fire and holding on we find That's what love is for To help us through it That's what love is for Nothing else can do it Melt our defenses Bring us back to our senses Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for Believing in the one thing That has gotten us this far That's what love is for To help us through it That's what love is for Nothing else can do it Round off the edges Talk us down from the ledges Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for That's what love is for That's what love is for That's what love is for Melt our defenses Bring us back to our senses Give us strength to try once more Baby, that's what love is for That's what love is for That's what love is for That's what love is for Nothing else can do it Try to sense through it
