  Sure I've been in love a time or two But in the end I still chose you No one could ever make me feel this way That's why it's killing me what we're going through Somehow thought 'tween me and you Our love would stand the test of time and never ever fade But we're not making love no more We're not even trying to change Tell me how it slips away Does it ever stay the same We don't even talk no more We've ran out of words to say Tell me it don't have to change Won't it ever stay the same Girl I know that things aren't going right But don't you think it deserves a fight A love like ours don't happen everyday And we're losing it right as we speak And if we don't wake up, it's a memory A time gone past, a love that sailed away But we're not making love no more We're not even trying to change Tell me how it slips away Does it ever stay the same We don't even talk no more We've ran out of words to say Tell me it don't have to change Won't it ever stay the same I dream of lovers past and I see a girl so sad cause She lost the only man she loved He went away Well it's not too late for us To change But we're not making love no more We're not even trying to change Tell me how it slips away Does it ever stay the same We don't even talk no more We've ran out of words to say Tell me it don't have to change Won't it ever stay the same 
  I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden And she lives for me She says she lives for me Ovation She's got her own motivation She comes round and she goes down on me And I make her smile It's like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do Coming over you Keep on smiling, what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse And I come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play, she said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye The sky it was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take Doing crystal myth Will lift you up until you break It won't stop I won't come down, I keep stock With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop And then I bumped up I took the hit I was given Then I bumped again And then I bumped again How do I get back there to The place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to The place where you said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling An earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right All right When the plane came in She said she was crashing The velvet it rips In the city we tripped On the urge to feel alive But now I'm struggling to survive The days you were wearing That velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties They pass the test Slide up around the belly Face down on the mattress One Now you hold me And we're broken Still its all that I want to do just a little I Feel myself with a head made of the ground I'm scared but I'm not coming down And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws just locked now in smile But nothing is all right All right I want something else To get me through this life I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye 
  When I'm done with thinking then I'm done with you. When I'm done with crying then I'm done with you. When I feel so tired then I'm done with you. Everybody feels this way sometimes everybody feels this way And I do. You can't hear it but I do. You can't hear it but I do. You're trying to convince me that what I've done's not right. I get so frustrated I stay up every night. You ask me for an answer and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air. Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way And I do. You can't hear it, but I do. You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say I will be ignored. I will be denied. I could be erased. I could be brushed aside I will get scared, and I will get shoved down, But I feel like I do because you push me around. I'm starting to ignore you, I've doubted you so long. I'm tired of overthinking, I know you don't belong. Now I'm asking questions - no one pushes me around. Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way - And I do. You can't hear it, but I do. You don't seem angry, but I do. I do.

I loved the way you only kissed me bye All of your friends think I'm just too young for you So tell them that I can do what girls their age can do Aw babe [Chorus: x2] Aw It never really mattered too much to me That they were just too damned blind to see As long as I can love you down baby just be my man That's all that matters to me [Chorus] Let me love you down Ooh Let me love you down, I know, I know I could Love you down, down, ooh Love you down, down, no no no no no no no Let me love you, I want to love you, down Let me love you, I want to love you, down baby

We all feel pain, we all go through things But it's time to overcome all that If your plane crashed in the water and everybody died Would you drown on purpose or try to survive? I was born handicapped my arm wouldn't move They called me a cripple pops caught an attitude Beat my moms smoked lye drove trucks My moms had a miscarriage, he didn't give a fuck He sniffed some coke, come home Beat up on my moms cause she's talkin' on the phone Come on [Chorus] (All I ever wanted) All I ever wanted (All I ever needed) All I ever needed (Was a father) Was a father (That's all) That's all!
