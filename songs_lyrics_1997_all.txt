  Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart You called out to our country And you whispered to those in pain Now you belong to heaven And the stars spell out your name And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will Loveliness we've lost These empty days without your smile This torch we'll always carry For our nation's golden child And even though we try The truth brings us to tears All our words cannot express The joy you brought us through the years And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned our long before Your legend ever will Goodbye England's rose May you ever grow in our hearts You were the grace that placed itself Where lives were torn apart Goodbye England's rose From a country lost without your soul Who'll miss the wings of your compassion More than you'll ever know And it seems to me you lived your life Like a candle in the wind Never fading with the sunset When the rain set in And your footsteps will always fall here Along England's greenest hills Your candle's burned out long before Your legend ever will

  I'm packed and I'm holding I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden And she lives for me She says she lives for me Ovation She's got her own motivation She comes round and she goes down on me And I make her smile It's like a drug for you Do ever what you want to do Coming over you Keep on smiling, what we go through One stop to the rhythm that divides you And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse Chop another line like a coda with a curse And I come on like a freak show takes the stage We give them the games we play, she said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye The sky it was gold, it was rose I was taking sips of it through my nose And I wish I could get back there Some place back there Smiling in the pictures you would take Doing crystal myth Will lift you up until you break It won't stop I won't come down, I keep stock With a tick-tock rhythm and a bump for the drop And then I bumped up I took the hit I was given Then I bumped again And then I bumped again How do I get back there to The place where I fell asleep inside you? How do I get myself back to The place where you said I want something else To get me through this Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye I believe in the sand beneath my toes The beach gives a feeling An earthy feeling I believe in the faith that grows And the four right chords can make me cry When I'm with you I feel like I could die And that would be all right All right When the plane came in She said she was crashing The velvet it rips In the city we tripped On the urge to feel alive But now I'm struggling to survive The days you were wearing That velvet dress You're the priestess, I must confess Those little red panties They pass the test Slide up around the belly Face down on the mattress One Now you hold me And we're broken Still its all that I want to do just a little I Feel myself with a head made of the ground I'm scared but I'm not coming down And I won't run for my life She's got her jaws just locked now in smile But nothing is all right All right I want something else To get me through this life I want something else I'm not listening when you say Good-bye 
  I know what you're doing I see it all too clear I only taste the saline When I kiss away your tears You really had me going, wishing on a star But the black holes that surround you Are heavier by far I believed in your confusion You were so completely torn Well it must have been that yesterday Was the day that I was born There's not much to examine There's nothing left to hide You really can't be serious If you have to ask me why I say good-bye 'Cause I am barely breathing And I can't find the air I don't know who I'm kidding Imagining you care, and I could stand here Waiting a fool for another day But I don't suppose it's worth the price Worth the price, the price that I would pay Everyone keeps asking, what's it all about? I used to be so certain and I can't figure out What is this attraction? I only feel the pain There's nothing left to reason and only you to blame Will it ever change? 'Cause I am barely breathing And I can't find the air I don't know who I'm kidding Imagining you care, and I could stand here Waiting a fool for another day But I don't suppose it's worth the price Worth the price, the price that I would pay But I'm thinking it over anyway I've come to find, I may never know Your changing mind, is it friend or foe? I rise above or sink below With every time you come and go Please don't, you come and go 'Cause I am barely breathing And I can't find the air I don't know who I'm kidding Imagining you care, and I could stand here Waiting a fool for another day But I don't suppose it's worth the price Worth the price, the price that I would pay

  Just tell me what you've got to say to me I've been waiting for so long to hear the truth It comes as no surprise at all you see So cut the crap and tell me that we're through Now I know your heart, I know your mind You don't even know you're bein' unkind So much for all your highbrow Marxist ways Just use me up and then you walk away Boy, you can't play me that way Well I guess what you say is true I could never be the right kind of girl for you I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman When I saw my best friend yesterday She said she never liked you from the start Well me, I wish that I could claim the same But you always knew you held my heart And you're such a charming, handsome man Now I think I finally understand Is it in your genes I don't know But I'll soon find out, that's for sure Why did you play me this way Well I guess what you say is true I could never be the right kind of girl for you I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman Well I guess what they say is true I could never spend my life with a man like you I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman I could never be your woman 
  Now I've seen places and faces And things you ain't never thought about thinking If you ain't peek then you must be drinking And smokin' Pretending not to locin' but you're brokin' Let me get you open Now little Timmy got his diploma and Little Jimmy got life And Tamikra around the corner just took her first hit off the pipe The other homie shot the other homie and ran away with his money And when the other homies heard about it they thought it was funny But who's the dummy Now you done lost the hustler A down-ass brother got replaced by a buster And though I got love for ya I know I can't trust ya 'Cause my crew is rollin' home and your crew is rollin' dusta And just because of that you act you don't like the brother no more Uh, I guess that's just the way it goes I ain't tryin' preach I believe I can reach But your mind ain't prepared I see you when you get there [Chorus] I'll see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there I'll see you when you get there If you ever get there See you when you get there More temptation in faith I guess we livin' for the day I seen a man get swept off his feet By a bullet and an AK The situation so twisted everybody gettin' lifted I'm just tryin' to take care of my kids and handle my business 'Cause it way too serious so you gotta pay close attention So you don't get caught sittin' when they come and do all the gettin' Life is a big game so you gotta play it with a big horse Someone's gotta run a little faster coz we gotta lay the struggle I'd be a fool to surrender when I know I can be a contender And if everbody's a sinner then everybody can be a winner No matter you rag collar deep down we all brothers And regardless of the time somebody up there still love us I'm a scuff and struggle y'all breathless and weak I just strived my whole life to make it to the mountain peak Always keep reaching sure to grab on to something I'll be there when you get there when you wit the sound bumpin' [Chorus] You need to loosen up And live a little And if you got kids let 'em know how ya feel For your own sake give a little Oh, you don't want to hear that You busy tryina stack And keep them from the Jones's is taking advantage of your own The realist homies got you but you known them longest But some ain't missing a good thing until it's gone Could have built an empire if not for the jealousy that divides us We prefer to keep our eyes shut to describe when It's something wrong and we desire So hold your head up high if your poor and righteous I know time seems dry and problems seem endless But in times of despair we gotta put ourselves together And if you feel you're out the game then you need to get back in it 'Cause nothing worse than a quitter You gotta face responsibility one day, my brother So gather up your pity and turn it to ambition And put your vehicle and drive and stop by my side [Chorus] As we walk down the road of our destiny And the time comes to choose which shall it be The wide and crooked, or the strait narrow, We got one voice to give and one life to live Stand up for somthing or lay down in your game Listen to the song that we sang It's up to you to make it be I guess I'll see you when you see me [Chorus] 
  If I could reach the stars I'd pull one down for you Shine it on my heart So you could see the truth That this love I have inside Is everything it seems But for now I find It's only in my dreams That I can Change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Baby if I could Change the world If I could be king Even for a day I'd take you as my queen I'd have it no other way And our love would rule In this kingdom that we had made 'til then i'll be a fool Wishing for a day That I can Change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Baby if I could Change the world

  [2Pac] There's gon' be some stuff you gon' see That's gon' make it hard to smile in the future. But through whatever you see, Through all the rain and the pain, You gotta keep your sense of humor. You gotta be able to smile through all this bullshit. Remember that. Mmm, yeah. Keep ya head up.Yeah. Verse One: 2Pac Our lifestyles be close captioned Addicted to fatal attractions Pictures of actions be played back In the midst of mashin' No fairy tales for this young black male Some see me stranded in this land of hell, jail, and crack sales Hustlin' and heart be a nigga culture Or the repercussions while bustin' on backstabbin' vultures Sellin' my soul for material wishes, fast cars and bitches Wishin' I live my life a legend, immortalized in pictures Why shed tears? Save your sympathy My childhood years were spent buryin' my peers in the cemetery Here's a message to the newborns, waitin' to breathe If you believe then you can achieve Just look at me Against all odds, though life is hard we carry on Livin' in the projects, broke with no lights on To all the seeds that follow me Protect your essence Born with less, but you still precious Just smile for me now [Chorus: Johnny P (2Pac)] Smile for me , won't you smile (smile for me now) Just smile (smile), smile for me (What ya looking all sad for, nigga you black, smile for me now) Smile for me (nigga you ain't got nothin' to be worried about) Won't you smile (no doubt, smile for me now) just smile (And the next generation) [Scarface] Now as I open up my story With the blaze a your blunts And you can picture thoughts slowly Up on phrases I wrote And I can walk you through the days that I done I often wish that I could save everyone But I'm a dreamer Have you ever seen a nigga who was strong in the game Overlookin' his tomorrows and they finally came? Look back on childhood memories and I'm still feelin' the pain Turnin' circles in my life came to dealin' cocaine To many hassles in my local life, survivin' the strain And a man without a focus, life could drive him insane Stuck inside a ghetto fantasy hopin' it'd change But when I focus on reality we broke and in chains Had a dream of livin' wealthy and makin' it big And after all my momma's thankin' God for blessin' the child All my momma gots to do now is collect it and smile Smile [Chorus] [2Pac] Fuck the world as we ? and witness furious speeds Of nasty questions keep us all stressin', curious G's Backstabbed and bleedin', fuckin' thoughts laced with weed Learnin', duckin' stray shots, bullets be hot, they burnin' Inhalin' Sherm smoke, visualized the flames Will I be smothered by my own pain? Strange whispers, cowards conversate, so quick to dis us Takin' pictures for the feds, and desperate hopes they'd get us Hit us off, give us plenty centuries, forgive my sins Since I ain't in many penitentiaries the best revenge is fuck friends We military minded soldiers, bustin' shots blindly Tryin' to find Jehovah to help me Somebody save me Lost and crazy, scared to drop a seed hopin' I ain't cursed my babies Maybe now niggas feel me now, picture my pain Embrace my words make the world change And still I smile nigga [Scarface] And now a moment of silence, let us pray And as you journey into outer space May the angels help to lead the way Shine up on your soul to keep you safe And all the homies that done passed away They there to greet you as you pass the gates And as you headed to the tunnel's light I hope it leads to eternal life We say the prayers for our homie 'Pac Smile (Smile for me) (All ya need to do is smile) (Woo smile for me) (Come on smile for me)

  She'll let you in her house If you come knockin' late at night She'll let you in her mouth If the words you say are right If you pay the price She'll let you deep inside But there's a secret garden she hides She'll let you in her car To go drivin' round She'll let you into the parts of herself That'll bring you down She'll let you in herheart If you got a hammer and a vise But into her secret garden, don't think twice You've gone a million miles How far'd you get To that place where You can't remember And you can't forget She'll lead you down a path There'll be tenderness in the air She'll let you come just far enough So you know she's really there She'll look at you and smile And her eyes will say She's got a secret garden Where everything you want Where everything you need Will always stay A million miles away
