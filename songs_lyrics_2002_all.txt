  It starts with one thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on, but you didn't even know I wasted it all just to watch you go I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me Will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn't even matter how hard you try, Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme, To remind myself of a time when I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so Things aren't the way they were before You wouldn't even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me in the end I kept everything inside And even though I tried, it all fell apart What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter

  Where's my snare? I have no snare in my headphones there you go Yeah yo, yo Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have, I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now, I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it, I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes, but I'm only human but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 'Cause I'da killed him, shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show" I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position, just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch, I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be! I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet

  It's painted red, the stripe was white It was eighteen feet from the bow to the stern light Second hand from a dealer in Atlanta I rode up with Daddy when he went there to get her Put on a shine, put on a motor Built out of love, made for the water Ran her for years, till the transom got rotten A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten It was just an old plywood boat A '75 Johnson with electric choke A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it make me feel And I would turn her sharp And I would make her whine He'd say, you can't beat the way an old wood boat rides Just a little lake across the Alabama line But I was king of the ocean When Daddy let me drive Just an old half-ton shortbed Ford My uncle bought new in '64 Daddy got it right 'cause the engine was smoking Couple of burned valves and he had it going He let me drive here when we'd haul off a load Down a dirt strip where we'd dump trash off of Thigpen Road Sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals Smiling like a hero that just received his medal It was just an old hand-me-down Ford With three-speed on the column and a dent in the door A young boy two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And I would press that clutch And I would keep it right And he'd say, a little slower son you're doing just fine Just a dirt road with trash on each side But I was Mario Andretti When Daddy let me drive I'm grown up now three daughters of my own To let them drive my old Jeep across a pasture in our home Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file And pull out that old memory And think of me and smile, and say Just an old worn-out Jeep Rusty old floorboard, hot on my feet A young girl two hands on the wheel I can't replace the way it made me feel And he'd say, turn it left and steer it right Straighten up girl now you're doing just fine Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride But I was high on a mountain When Daddy let me drive When Daddy let me drive Oh he let me drive Daddy let me drive It's just an old plywood boat With a '75 Johnson with electric choke 
  Cutting through the darkest night are my two headlights Try to keep it clear, but I'm losing it here To the twilight There's a dead end to my left There's a burning bush to my right You aren't in sight You aren't in sight Do you want me Like I want you Or am I standing still Beneath a darkened sky Or am I standing still With the scenery flying by Or am I standing still Out of the corner of my eye Was that you passing me by Mothers on the stoop Boys in souped-up coupes On this hot summer night Between fight and flight Is the blind man's sight And a choice that's right I roll the window down Feel like I'm gonna drown in this strange town Feel broken down Feel broken down Do you need me Like I need you Or am I standing still Beneath a darkened sky Or am I standing still With the scenery flying by Or am I standing still Out of the corner of my eye Was that you passing me by Sweet sorrow, he said call tomorrow Sweet sorrow, he said call tomorrow Do you love me Like I love you Or am I standing still Beneath a darkened sky Or am I standing still With the scenery flying by Or am I standing still Out of the corner of my eye Was that you passing me by are you passing me by, passing me by Do you want me passing me by Do you need me, like i need you to And do you want me, like i want you Are you passing me by or am I standing still 
  Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah I can picture us in the living room By the mantle piece And you're tellin' me you're lovin' me Put your hands on my thighs While I'm starin' in yo brown eyes And the expression on your face Is tellin' me you want more than a taste So tonight we're goin' all the way We'll be lovin' 'til the break of day [Chorus] There's nothin' in this world I wouldn't do for you boy I don't care what the others say now that I got you babe No one can bring me joy like you girl All the little things you do it's all about you boo I can picture us runnin' in the rain After a movie then we spark a flame Oh I love it when you scream my name Goin' 60 in a 30 lane We pull over to the parkin' lot In the park that's my favorite spot Doing just about anything We'll be goin' 'til the birds sing [Chorus] I think it's bout time that I make you mine Oh what your saying to me boy come on break it down To find another like you will be a lifetime I think I see where you're going baby let it out let it Out Listen to me baby got something to say Is it really what think don't take all day Forever is what I want to give to you so what do you say Baby I do [Chorus: x2]

  Under an old brass paperweight is my list of things to do today Go to the bank and the hardware store, put a new lock on the cellar door I cross 'em off as I get 'em done but when the sun is set There's still more than a few things left I haven't got to yet Go for a walk, say a little prayer Take a deep breath of mountain air Put on my glove and play some catch It's time that I make time for that Wade the shore and cast a line Look up a long lost friend of mine Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss Start livin', that's the next thing on my list Wouldn't change the course of fate but cuttin' the grass just had to wait Cause I've got more important things like pushin' my kid on the backyard swing I won't break my back for a million bucks I can't take to my grave So why put off for tomorrow what I could get done today Like go for a walk, say a little prayer Take a deep breath of mountain air Put on my glove and play some catch It's time that I make time for that Wade the shore and cast a line Look up a long lost friend of mine Sit on the porch and give my girl a kiss Start livin', that's the next thing on my list Raise a little hell, laugh 'til it hurts Put an extra five in the plate at church Call up my folks just to chat It's time that I make time for that Stay up late, then oversleep Show her what she means to me Catch up on all the things I've always missed Just start livin', that's the next thing on my list Under an old brass paperweight Is my list of things to do today

  Daddy sits on the front porch swinging, Looking out on a vacant field. Used to be filled with burley t'bacca. Now he knows it never will. My brother found work in Indiana, Sister's a nurse at the old folks home. Mama's still cooking too much for supper, And me, I've been a long time gone. Been a long time gone, No, I ain't hoed a row since I don't know when. Long time gone, and it ain't coming back again. Delia plays that ol' church piano, Sittin' out on her daddy's farm. She always thought that we'd be together, Lord, I never meant to do her harm. Said she could hear me singin' in the choir, Me, I heard another song. I caught wind and hit the road runnin', And Lord, I've been a long time gone. Been a long time gone, Lord, I ain't had a prayer since I don't know when. Long time gone, and it ain't comin' back again. Now me, I went to Nashville, Tryin' to beat the big deal. Playin' down on Broadway, Gettin' there the hard way. Living from a tip jar, Sleeping in my car. Hocking my guitar, Yeah, I'm gonna be a star. Now, me and Delia singing every Sunday, Watching the children and the garden grow. We listen to the radio to hear what's cookin', But the music ain't got no soul. Now they sound tired but they don't sound Haggard, They've got money but they don't have Cash. They got Junior but they don't have Hank. I think, I think, I think, the rest is, A long time gone, No, I ain't hit the roof since I don't know when. Long time gone, and it ain't coming back. I said a long time gone, No, I ain't honked the horn since I don't know when. Long time gone, and it ain't coming back again. I said a long time, long time, long time gone. Well, it's been a long time. Long time, long time, long time gone, Oh, it's been a long time gone. Long time, long time, long time gone. Yeah, yeah. 
  Where were you when the world stopped turnin' That September day? Were you in the yard with your wife and children Or workin' on some stage in L.A.? Did you stand there in shock at the sight of that black smoke Risin' against that blue sky? Did you shout out in anger, in fear for your neighbor Or did you just sit down and cry? Did you weep for the children, they lost their dear loved ones Pray for the ones who don't know? Did you rejoice for the people who walked from the rubble And sob for the ones left below? Did you burst out with pride for the red, white, and blue And the heroes who died just doin' what they do? Did you look up to heaven for some kind of answer And look at yourself and what really matters? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turnin' That September day? Teachin' a class full of innocent children Or drivin' down some cold interstate? Did you feel guilty 'cause you're a survivor? In a crowded room did you feel alone? Did you call up your mother and tell her you love her? Did you dust off that Bible at home? Did you open your eyes and hope it never happened Close your eyes and not go to sleep? Did you notice the sunset for the first time in ages And speak to some stranger on the street? Did you lay down at night and think of tomorrow Go out and buy you a gun? Did you turn off that violent old movie you're watchin' And turn on I Love Lucy reruns? Did you go to a church and hold hands with some strangers Stand in line to give your own blood? Did you just stay home and cling tight to your family Thank God you had somebody to love? I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love I'm just a singer of simple songs I'm not a real political man I watch CNN, but I'm not sure I can tell you The diff'rence in Iraq and Iran But I know Jesus and I talk to God And I remember this from when I was young Faith, hope, and love are some good things He gave us And the greatest is love And the greatest is love And the greatest is love Where were you when the world stopped turnin' On that September day?
