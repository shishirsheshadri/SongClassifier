All the miles that separate Disappear now when I'm dreamin' of your face. I'm here without you baby But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight girl, it's only you and me. The miles just keep rollin' As the people leave their way to say hello I've heard this life is overrated But I hope that it gets better as we go. I'm here without you baby But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, it's only you and me. Everything I know, and anywhere I go, It gets hard but it won't take away my love. And when the last one falls, when its all said and done. It gets hard but it won't take away my love. I'm here without you baby But you're still on my lonely mind. I think about you baby and I dream about you all the time. I'm here without you baby But you're still with me in my dreams And tonight, it's only you and me.

  My Dearest son, it's almost June I hope this letter catches up with you And finds you well It's been dry But they're callin' for rain And everything's the same old same In Johnsonville Your stubborn old daddy Ain't said too much But I'm sure you know He sends his love And she goes on In a letter from home I hold it up and show my buddies Like we ain't scared And our boots ain't muddy And they all laugh Like there's something funny 'Bout the way I talk When I say, "Mamma sends her best, y'all" I fold it up and put it in my shirt Pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me drivin' on Waitin' on letters from home My dearest love, it's almost dawn I've been lyin' here all night long Wonderin' where you might be I saw your mamma And I showed her the ring Man on the television Said something So I couldn't sleep But I'll be alright, I'm just missin' you And this is me kissin' you X's and O's in a letter from home I hold it up and show my buddies Like we ain't scared And our boots ain't muddy And they all laugh 'Cause she calls me honey, But they take it hard 'Cause I don't read the good parts I fold it up and put it in my shirt Pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me drivin' on Waitin' on letters from home Dear son, I know I ain't written I'm Sittin' here tonight alone in the kitchen It occurs to me I might not have said it So I'll say it now "Son, You make me proud" I hold it up and show my buddies Like we ain't scared And our boots ain't muddy But no one laughs 'Cause there's ain't nothin' funny When a soldier cries And I just wipe my eyes I fold it up and put it in my shirt Pick up my gun and get back to work And it keeps me drivin' on Waitin' on letters from home
