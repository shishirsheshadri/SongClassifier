  I can take the rain on the roof of this empty house That don't bother me I can take a few tears now and then and just let 'em out I'm not afraid to cry every once in a while Even though goin' on with you gone still upsets me There are days every now and again I pretend I'm okay But that's not what gets me What hurts the most was being so close And havin' so much to say And watchin' you walk away And never knowin' what could've been And not seein' that lovin' you Is what I was trying to do It's hard to deal with the pain of losin' you everywhere I go But I'm doing it It's hard to force that smile when I see our old friends and I'm alone Still harder gettin' up, gettin' dressed, livin' with this regret But I know if I could do it over I would trade, give away all the words that I saved in my heart That I left unspoken What hurts the most was being so close And havin' so much to say And watchin' you walk away And never knowin' what could've been And not seein' that lovin' you Is what I was trying to do, oh What hurts the most was being so close And havin' so much to say And watchin' you walk away And never knowin' what could've been And not seein' that lovin' you Is what I was trying to do (Not seeing that lovin' you) That's what I was trying to do, ooh 
  Step one, you say we need to talk He walks, you say sit down, it's just a talk He smiles politely back at you You stare politely right on through Some sort of window to your right As he goes left, and you stay right Between the lines of fear and blame You begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Let him know that you know best Cause after all, you do know best Try to slip past his defense Without granting innocence Lay down a list of what is wrong The things you've told him all along And pray to God he hears you And I pray to God he hears you Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life As he begins to raise his voice You lower yours and grant him one last choice Drive until you lose the road Or break with the ones you've followed He will do one of two things He will admit to everything Or he'll say he's just not the same And you'll begin to wonder why you came Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend Somewhere along in the bitterness And I would have stayed up with you all night Had I known how to save a life How to save a life How to save a life 
  Story of my life Searching for the right But it keeps avoiding me Sorrow in my soul 'Cause it seems that wrong Really loves my company He's more than a man And this is more than love The reason that the sky is blue The clouds are rolling in Because I'm gone again And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful And it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why Every time I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be A murderer I feel it in the air As I'm doing my hair Preparing for another date A kiss upon my cheek As he reluctantly Asks if I'm gonna be out late I say I won't be long Just hanging with the girls A lie I didn't have to tell Because we both know Where I'm about to go And we know it very well 'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful And it kills him inside To know that I am happy with some other guy I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why Every time I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be A murderer Our love, his trust I might as well take a gun and put it to his head Get it over with I don't wanna do this Anymore Uh Anymore And I don't wanna do this anymore I don't wanna be the reason why And every time I walk out the door I see him die a little more inside And I don't wanna hurt him anymore I don't wanna take away his life I don't wanna be A murderer A murderer No no no no Yeah yeah yeah yeah

  Damn baby I just don't understand where we went wrong I gave you my heart I gave you my soul I gave you [Verse 1] As a matter of fact I was the one who said I love you first, It was about 8 years ago Don't act like you don't know. We were sitting at home in your momma's living room, Cause, (We couldn't be alone) See your mamma knew I was something else, she knew how I felt. Back then we were in school, And that sure thing didn't excuse, Growing up I was a fool, And i can't lie im missin' you Listen and don't trip, Think I need a bottle with a genie in it. Here's my wish list, (First one), I would create a heart changing love (Second one), I'll take your lift and lead on (Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, I'll, be okay if I get one [Chorus] If I had one wish, we would be best friends Lovin' never end, It would just begin. If I had one wish, you would be my boo, Promise to love you, Trust me I'll trust you. If I had one wish, we would run away, Making love all day, Have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, Can you be my wife? Make it right this time. [Interlude] If I had one wish, One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish. One wish, one wish, one wish [Verse 2] And tell me is this the only way I, Can get you right back in. if so, then search and I'll go, Then I can have you for sure. Then you'll be loving me, Holding me, Kissing me. So girl don't tell me what, I'm feeling is make believe. I swear if I lose, A second chance with you, I wouldn't know what to do, I'd probably check myself in, To come kind of clinic, I couldn't be alone, because without you I'm sick Here's my wish list (First one), I would create a heart changing love (Second one), I'll take your lift and lead on (Third one), but I don't need a lot of wishes cause, I'll, be okay if I get one [Chorus] If I had one wish, we would be best friends (we'd be best friends) Lovin' never end, (never end) It would just begin. (Starting here right now) If I had one wish, you would be my boo, Promise to love you, (promise to love) Trust me I'll trust you. (I trust you) If I had one wish, we would run away, (yes we would) Making love all day, (it would feel so good) Have us a baby. If I had one wish, I'd make you my whole life, (oh yeah) Can you be my wife? Make it right this time. If I had one wish I don't even know How we ended up on this road, And even though we are grown, Girl I just want you to know [Chorus ]

Just make a smile come back And shine just like it used to be And then she whispered, "How can you do this to me?" Hate me today Hate me tomorrow Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you Hate me in ways Yeah, ways hard to swallow Hate me so you can finally see what's good for you For you For you For you

I can't find mommy, where is she?" "I don't know, go play, Hailie baby, your daddy's busy Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon write itself" I give you one underdog, and you gotta swing by yourself Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her And put hands on her mother who's the spittin' image of her That's Slim Shady, yeah baby Slim Shady's crazy Shady made me But tonight, Shady's rock-a-bye baby And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back I keep havin' this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on a swing, she keeps screamin', she don't want me to sing "You're makin' mommy cry, why, why is mommy cryin'" "Baby, daddy ain't leavin' no more, Daddy you're lyin' You always say that, you always say this is the last time But you ain't leavin' no more daddy, you're mine" She's pilin' boxes in front of the door tryin' to block it "Daddy please, daddy, don't leave, daddy, no, stop it" Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket It's got a picture, "This will keep you safe daddy, take it with ya" I look up, it's just me standin' in the mirror These fuckin' walls must be talkin', 'cause man I can hear 'em They're sayin', "you got one more chance to do right And it's tonight, now go out and show em that you love 'em before it's too late" And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door It turns to a stage, they're gone and the spotlight is on and I'm singin' And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back Sixty thousand people all jumpin' out their seat The curtain closes, they're throwin' roses at my feet I take a bow, and thank you all for comin out They're screamin' so loud, I take one last look at the crowd I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seein' "Daddy, its me, help mommy, her wrists are bleedin'" But baby we're in Sweden How did you get to Sweden? "I followed you daddy You told me that you weren't leavin' You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad And I bought you this coin, it says number one dad That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin" "I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'" "But baby wait, it's too late dad, you made your choice Now go out there and show em that you love em more than us That's what they want They want you, Marshall They keep screamin' your name It's no wonder you can't go to sleep Just take another pill, yeah I bet you you will! You rap about it, yeah word, kid keep it real" I hear a applause, all this time I couldn't see How could it be, that the curtain is closin' on me I turn around, find a gun on the ground Cock it, put it to my brain, scream Die Shady! And pop it The sky darkens, my life flashes The plane that I was supposed to be on, crashes, and burns to ashes That's when I wake up Alarm clock's ringing, there's birds singin' It's spring and Hailie's outside swingin' I walk right up to Kim and kiss her tell her I miss her Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister almost as if to say And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back And when I'm gone just carry on don't mourn, Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice, just know that, I'm lookin' down on you smilin' And I didn't feel a thing so baby, don't feel no pain, just smile back
