  We were both young when I first saw you I close my eyes And the flashback starts I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air See the lights See the party, the ball gowns I see you make your way through the crowd You say ''hello'', little did I know That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said stay away from Juliet And I was crying on the staircase Begging you please don't go, and I said ''Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say yes" So I sneak out to the garden to see you We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew So close your eyes Escape this town for a little while 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter And my daddy said stay away from Juliet But you were everything to me I was begging you please don't go and I said ''Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone I'll be waiting all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess It's a love story baby just say yes'' ''Romeo save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult, but it's real Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess It's a love story baby just say yes'' Oh oh oh oh I got tired of waiting Wondering if you were ever coming around My faith in you was fading When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said ''Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone I keep waiting for you but you never come Is this in my head? I don't know what to think" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said ''Marry me Juliet, you'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story baby just say... yes" Oh, oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you.

He said, ask anything Where were you When everything was falling apart? All my days Spent by the telephone That never rang And all I needed was a call That never came From the corner of First and Amistad Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you, where were you? Just a little late You found me, you found me In the end Everyone ends up alone Losing her The only one who's ever known Who I am, who I'm not, and who I wanna be No way to know How long she will be next to me Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you, where were you? Just a little late You found me, you found me Early morning City breaks I've been calling For years and years and years and years And you never left me no messages You never send me no letters You got some kind of nerve Taking all I want Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lying on the floor Where were you? Where were you? Lost and insecure You found me, you found me Lying on the floor Surrounded, surrounded Why'd you have to wait? Where were you, where were you?
