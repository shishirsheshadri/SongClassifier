  May I have your attention please? May I have your attention please? Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're going to have a problem here Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door Started whoopin' her ass worse than before, they first get divorced Throwing her over furniture It's the return of the "Oh wait, no way, your kidding, He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"

Of course they gonna know what intercourse is, by the time they hit 4th grade, They got the discovery channel don't they? We ain't nothing but mammals, Well some of us cannibals, who cut other people open like cantaloupes. But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope But if you feel like I feel I got the antidote.

  Sorry didn't mean to call you but I couldn't fight it I guess I was weak, couldn't even hide it And so I surrendered, just to hear your voice. Don't know how many times I said I'm gonna live without you, And maybe someone else is standing there beside you, But there's something, baby you need to know. That deep inside me, I feel like I'm dying. I have to see you, It's all that I'm asking. Vida, give me back my fantasy. The courage that I need to live, The air that I breathe. CariÃ±o mio, my world's become so empty. The days are so cold and lonely And each night I taste the purest of pain. Quisiera decirte que hoy estoy de maravilla Que no me ha afectado lo de tu partida Pero con un dedo no se tapa el sol. Estoy muriendo, muriendo por verte. Agonizando, muy lento why muy fuerte. Vida, devuelveme mis fantasias, mis ganas de vivir la vida, devuelveme el aire. CariÃ±o mio, sin tin yo me siento vacio, las tardes son un laberinto, las noches Me saben, a puro dolor. -chorus- (repeat chorus again softly) Vida, give me back my fantasy. The courage that I need to live, The air that I breathe. CariÃ±o mio, my world's become so empty. The days are so cold and lonely And each night I taste the purest of pain. I'm sorry I didn't mean to call you but I couldn't fight it. I guess I was weak, couldn't even hide it And so I surrendered just to hear your voice. 
  I ain't no hata or nothing But he can't love you like I can Trust me Ooh, ooh, ooh As the clock strikes twelve I'm sitting here wondering how the hell Did I let you leave And baby I know that I did my share Of things to deceive you I'm just trying to get an understanding Of what to do Cause I'm half way going crazy Girl they can't fade me He can't love you like I love you Baby you know it too And you should never wanna be with a man If he can't be a man And do the things to you like I can He can't love you like I love you Baby you know it too And you should never wanna be with a man If he can't be a man And do the things to you like I can I stop, and I wait, and I think That I never met someone to make me feel Like I'm ready to love So I gotta do what I gotta do Just to keep you Keep you here with me baby Now I feel it's time for me to say That I need you boo And I can't go a day without your loving Baby I can't live without you I know you know No matter if you want it baby Ain't no ifs, or buts, or maybes And I know that one day you'll see That he can't really love you like I love you He can't love you like I love you Baby you know it too And you should never wanna be with a man If he can't be a man And do the things to you like I can He can't love you like I love you Baby you know it too And you should never wanna be with a man If he can't be a man And do the things to you like I can He can't, he can't love you girl He's never gonna love you girl Like I love you girl He can't, he can't love you girl He's never gonna love you girl Like I love you girl He can't, he can't love you girl He's never gonna love you girl Like I love you girl He can't, he can't love you girl He can't love you like I love you Baby you know it too And you should never wanna be with a man If he can't be a man And do the things to you like I can

  It was love at first sight I know from the way she looked at me Her eyes said it all Long days and nights, we spent Until she dropped the bomb on me When she said that she Was unhappily married with children And I wish I never met her at all Even though I love her so She got love from me But she still belongs to someone else It hurts so bad, for sure Because she wants to be with me But she cannot be with me She chose to stay, at home So they could be a family For the children But what about me? And I wish I never met her at all Even though I love her so She got love from me But she still belongs to someone else Maybe in another life Things could be the way we both desired It's a catch-22 Either way it went Someone had to lose And I wish I never met her at all Even though I love her so She got love from me But she still belongs to someone else And I wish I never met her at all Even though I love her so She got love from me But she still belongs to someone else I wish I wish I never met her at all I wouldn't hurt so much inside Oh I wouldn't feel this pain If I never met her at all, at all, at all Wish I never, wish I never

  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Your love for me came as a waterfall Flowin' inside me like never before Your love for me, somethin' I didn't see But baby, I know better now When you walk in the room that very night A special feelin' just burst inside It was only you, nobody else But baby, I know better now Don't want to love you if you don't love me Don't want to need you when you won't need me too Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be Right If I didn't tell you this tonight Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah And now you're back inside my house again I'm tryin' deeper to explain 'Cause baby, I want to get it on And baby, you're the one for me But now that I have got you all alone After all this talkin' on the phone I should be strong, there's nothing wrong I'll tell you this is where you belong, where you Belong Don't want to love you if you don't love me Don't want to need you when you won't need me too Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be Right If I didn't tell you this tonight Don't want to love you if you don't love me Don't want to need you when you won't need me too Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be Right If I didn't tell you this tonight It was just something in your eyes That made me realize But now I hear voices deep inside Tellin' me, tellin' me It's you Don't want to love you if you don't love me Don't want to need you when you won't need me too Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be Right If I didn't tell you this tonight Don't want to love you if you don't love me Don't want to need you when you won't need me too Don't want to tell you this now, but it wouldn't be Right If I didn't tell you this tonight 
  Like a movie scene, In the sweetest dreams, I have pictured us together Now to fell your lips, On my finger tips, I have to say is even better Than I ever thought it could possibly be It's perfect, it's passion, its setting me free From all of my sadness, The tears that I've cried, I have spent all my life Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight Tender words you say, Take my breath away, Love me now, and leave me never Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace, I want to stay in this forever I think of the days when the sun used to set, On my empty heart, All alone in my bed Tossing and turning emotions were strong, I knew I had to hold on Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight Gone are the days when the sun used to set, On my empty heart all alone in my bed Tossing and turning, Emotions were strong I knew I had to hold on Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight, Oh When you would be here in my arms Waiting for tonight, Oh I've dreamed of this love for so long Waiting for tonight, Oh
