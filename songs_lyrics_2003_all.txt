  I was raised off of Rural Route 3 Out past where the blacktop ends We'd walk to church on Sunday morning Race barefoot back to Johnson's fence That's where I first saw Mary On that roadside picking blackberries That summer I turned a corner in my soul Down that red dirt road It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car, I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers I've learned, I've come to know There's life at both ends Of that red dirt road Her daddy didn't like me much In my shackled up GTO I'd sneak out in the middle of the night Throw rocks at her bedroom window We'd turn out the headlights Drive by the moonlight Talk about what the future might hold Down that red dirt road It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car, I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers I've learned, I've come to know There's life at both ends Of that red dirt road I went out into the world And I came back in I lost Mary, Oh I got her back again And driving home tonight, Feels like I've found a long lost friend It's where I drank my first beer It's where I found Jesus Where I wrecked my first car, I tore it all to pieces I learned the path to heaven Is full of sinners and believers Learned that happiness on earth Ain't just for high achievers I've learned, I've come to know There's life at both ends Of that red dirt road 
  Becky was a beauty from south Alabama Her Daddy had a heart like a nine-pound hammer Think he even did a little time in the slammer What was I thinkin' She snuck out one night And met me by the front gate Her Daddy came out wavin' that twelve gauge We tore out the drive he peppered my tailgate What was I thinkin' Oh, I knew there'd be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late 'Cause I was Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top Sittin' right there in the middle by me I was thinkin' bout a long kiss Man just gotta get goin' Where the night might lead I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin' What was I thinkin' By the county line The cops were nippn' on our heels Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel Shut off the lights and tore through a corn field What was I thinkin' Out the other side she was hollerin' faster Took a dirt road had the radio blastin' Hit the honky-tonk for a little close dancin' What was I thinkin' Oh I knew there'd be hell to pay But that crossed my mind a little too late 'Cause I was Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top Sittin' right there in the middle by me I was thinkin' bout a long kiss Man just gotta get goin' Where the night might lead I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin' When a mountain of a man With a "born to kill" tattoo Tried to cut in I knocked out his front tooth We ran outside hood-slidin' like Bo Duke What was I thinkin' I finally got her home at a half past too late Her Daddy's in a lawn chair Sittin' on the driveway Put it in park as he started my way What was I thinkin' Oh what was I thinkin' Oh what was I thinkin' Then she gave a come-and-get-me grin And like a bullet we were gone again 'Cause I was Thinkin 'bout a little white tank top Sittin' right there in the middle by me I was thinkin' bout a long kiss Man just gotta get goin' Where the night might lead I know what I was feelin' Yeah I know what I was feelin But what was I thinkin', what was I thinkin' I know what I was feelin' But what was I thinkin' Guess I was thinking about that tank top Those cutoffs, hahaha 
  Everybody's looking for that something One thing that makes it all complete You'll find it in the strangest places Places you never knew it could be Some find it in the faces of their children Some find it in their lover's eyes Who can deny the joy it brings When you've found that special thing You're flying with out wings Some find it in sharing every morning Some in their solitary lives You'll find it in the words of others A simple line can make you laugh or cry You'll find it in the deepest friendship The kind you cherish all your life And when you know how much that means You've found that special thing You're flying without wings So, impossible as it may seem You've got to fight for every dream Cause who's to know which one you let go Would have made you complete Well, for me it's waking up beside you To watch the sunlight on your face To know that I can say I love you In any given time or place It's the little things that only I know Those are the things that make you mine And it's the flying without wings Cause you're my special thing I'm flying without wings And you're the place my life begins And you'll be where it ends I'm flying without wings And that's the joy you bring I'm flying without wings 
  These ideas are nightmares to white parents Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings Like whatever they say has no bearing It's so scary in a house that allows no swearing To see him walking around with his headphones blaring Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care He's a problem child, what bothers him all comes out When he talks about his fuckin' dad walkin' out Cause he hates him so bad that he blocks him out If he ever saw him again, he'd probably knock him out His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back Talkin' black, brainwashed from rock and rap He sags his pants, do rags and a stocking cap His stepfather hit him so he socked him back And broke his nose, this house is a broken home There's no control, he just let's his emotions go (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years (Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on) Sing it with me, just for today, Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away Entertainment is changing, intertwining' with gangsters In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely, 'cause don't anyone know me But everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standin' on corners and porches just rappin' To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get their hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon Any dispute, won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listenin' to me religiously So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense b It's all political, if my music is literal then I'm a criminal How the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too, Guerrera, that was a fist that hit you (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years (Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on) Sing it with me, just for today, Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See what these kids do, is hear about us totin' pistols And they want to get one, 'cus they think the shit's cool Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting ourselves You ignoramus but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it, how we can come from practically nothin' To bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted That's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fuckin' rap magazine Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives 'Til they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die 'Til they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in their eyes That's why we seize the moment, and try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, 'cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on, through our lyrics that you hear in our songs And we can (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years (Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on) Sing it with me, just for today, Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away (Come on) Sing with me, (Sing), sing for the years (Sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears (Come on) Sing it with me, just for today, Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away 
  I hear people saying we don't need this war I say there's some things worth fighting for What about our freedom and this piece of ground We didn't get to keep 'em by backing down They say we don't realize the mess we're getting in Before you start your preaching Let me ask you this my friend Have you forgotten how it felt that day To see your homeland under fire And her people blown away Have you forgotten when those towers fell We had neighbors still inside Going through a living hell And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden Have you forgotten They took all the footage off my TV Said it's too disturbing for you and me It'll just breed anger that's what the experts say If it was up to me I'd show it everyday Some say this country's just out looking for a fight After 9/11 man I'd have to say that's right Have you forgotten how it felt that day To see your homeland under fire And her people blown away Have you forgotten when those towers fell We had neighbors still inside Going through a living hell And you say we shouldn't worry 'bout Bin Laden Have you forgotten I've been there with the soldiers Who've gone away to war And you can bet that they remember Just what they're fighting for Have you forgotten all the people killed Some went down like heros in that Pennsylvania field Have you forgotten about our Pentagon All the loved ones that we lost And those left to carry on Don't you tell me not to worry about Bin Laden Have you forgotten Have you forgotten Have you forgotten 
  I've been up to my neck Workin' six days a week. Wearin' holes in the soles Of the shoes on my feet. Been dreamin' of gettin' away Since I don't know. Ain't no better time than now for Mexico No shoes, no shirt, and no problems Blues, what blues? Hey I forgot 'em. The sun and the sand, And a drink in my hand with no bottom, And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems, No problems. Want a towel on a chair In the sand by the sea, Want to look through my shades, And see you there with me. Want to soak up life for a while, In laid back mode. No boss, no clock, no stress, no dress code No shoes, no shirt, no problems Blues, what blues? Hey I forgot 'em. The sun and the sand, And a drink in my hand with no bottom, And no shoes, no shirt, and no problems, Babe lets get packed Tank tops and flip flops, If you got 'em. And no shoes, and no shirt, and no problems, No problems.

  On a cobweb afternoon In a room full of emptiness By a freeway I confess I was lost in the pages Of a book full of death Reading how we'll die alone And if we're good, we'll lay to rest Anywhere we want to go In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone On my deathbed I will pray To the gods and the angels Like a pagan to anyone Who will take me to heaven To a place I recall I was there so long ago The sky was bruised The wine was bled And there you led me on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone Alone And on I read Until the day was gone And I sat in regret Of all the things I've done For all that I've blessed And all that I've wronged In dreams until my death I will wander on In your house I long to be Room by room patiently I'll wait for you there Like a stone I'll wait for you there Alone Alone 
  I waited 'til I saw the sun I don't know why I didn't come I left you by the house of fun I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come When I saw the break of day I wished that I could fly away Instead of kneeling in the sand Catching teardrops in my hand My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind Forever Out across the endless sea I would die in ecstasy But I'll be a bag of bones Driving down the road alone My heart is drenched in wine But you'll be on my mind Forever Something has to make you run I don't know why I didn't come I feel as empty as a drum I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come I don't know why I didn't come
