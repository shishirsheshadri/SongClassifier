  There were nights when the wind was so cold That my body froze in bed If I just listened to it Right outside the window There were days when the sun was so cruel That all the tears turned to dust And I just knew my eyes were Drying up forever I finished crying in the instant that you left And I can't remember where or when or how And I banished every memory you and I had ever made But when you touch me like this And you hold me like that I just have to admit That it's all coming back to me When I touch you like this And I hold you like that It's so hard to believe but It's all coming back to me (It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now) There were moments of gold And there were flashes of light There were things I'd never do again But then they'd always seemed right There were nights of endless pleasure It was more than any laws allow Baby baby If I kiss you like this And if you whisper like that It was lost long ago But it's all coming back to me If you want me like this And if you need me like that It was dead long ago But it's all coming back to me It's so hard to resist And it's all coming back to me I can barely recall But it's all coming back to me now But it's all coming back There were those empty threats and hollow lies And whenever you tried to hurt me I just hurt you even worse And so much deeper There were hours that just went on for days When alone at last we'd count up all the chances That were lost to us forever But you were history with the slamming of the door And I made myself so strong again somehow And I never wasted any of my time on you since then But if I touch you like this And if you kiss me like that It was so long ago But it's all coming back to me If you touch me like this And if I kiss you like that It was gone with the wind But it's all coming back to me (It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now) There were moments of gold And there were flashes of light There were things we'd never do again But then they'd always seemed right There were nights of endless pleasure It was more than all your laws allow Baby, baby, baby When you touch me like this And when you hold me like that It was gone with the wind But it's all coming back to me When you see me like this And when I see you like that Then we see what we want to see All coming back to me The flesh and the fantasies All coming back to me I can barely recall But it's all coming back to me now If you forgive me all this If I forgive you all that We forgive and forget And it's all coming back to me When you see me like this And when I see you like that We see just what we want to see Al coming back to me The flesh and the fantasies All coming back to me I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now (It's all coming back to me now) And when you kiss me like this (It's all coming back to me now) And when I touch you like that (It's all coming back to me now) If you do it like this (It's all coming back to me now) And if we 
  If I could reach the stars I'd pull one down for you Shine it on my heart So you could see the truth That this love I have inside Is everything it seems But for now I find It's only in my dreams That I can Change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Baby if I could Change the world If I could be king Even for a day I'd take you as my queen I'd have it no other way And our love would rule In this kingdom that we had made 'til then i'll be a fool Wishing for a day That I can Change the world I would be the sunlight in your universe You would think my love was really something good Baby if I could Change the world

  How do you cool your lips, after a summer's kiss? How do you rid the sweat, after the body's bliss? How do you turn your eyes, from the romantic glare? How do you block the sound Of a voice you'd know anywhere? Oh, I really should have known By the time you drove me home By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual good-byes By the chill in your embrace The expression on your face, told me Maybe, you might have some advice to give How to be insensitive, insensitive ooh, insensitive How do you numb your skin, after the warmest touch? How do you slow your blood, after the body rush? How do you free your soul, after you've found a friend? How do you teach your heart It's a crime to fall in love again? Oh, you probably won't remember me It's probably ancient history I'm one of the chosen few Who went ahead and fell for you I'm out of vogue, I'm out of touch I fell too fast I feel too much I thought that you might have some advice to give, How to be insensitive Oh, I really should have known By the time you drove me home By the vagueness in your eyes, your casual good-byes By the chill in your embrace The expression on your face, told me Maybe, you might have some advice to give How to be insensitive, insensitive ooh, insensitive

  Even though the moment passed me by, I still can't turn away All the dreams you never thought you'd lose got tossed along the way Letters that you never meant to send lost or thrown away Now we're grown up orphans that never knew their names We don't belong to no one That's a shame If you could hide inside me, maybe for awhile, and I won't tell no one your name And I won't tell 'em your name Scars are souvenirs you never lose, the past is never far And did you lose yourself somewhere out there? Did you get to be a star? Don't make you sad to know that life is more than who you are? Grew up way too fast and now there's nothing to believe Reruns all become our history A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio, And I won't tell 'em your name And I won't tell 'em your name And I won't tell 'em your name I think about you all the time, but I don't need the same It's lonely where you are Come back down and I won't tell 'em your name 
  People living their lives for you on T.V. They say they're better than you and you agree He says "Hold my calls from behind those cold brick walls" Says "Come here boys, there ain't nothing for free" Another doctor's bill, a lawyer's bill Another cute cheap thrill You know you love him if you put in your will but Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now Huh huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy And who will save your souls if you won't save your own? We try to hustle them, try to bustle them, try to cuss them The cops want someone to bust down on Orleans Avenue Another day, another dollar, another war, another tower Went up where the homeless had their homes So we pray to as many different Gods as there are flowers We call religion our friend We're so worried about saving our souls Afraid that God will take his toll That we forget to begin but Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now Huh huh who will save your souls after all the lies that you told, boy And who will save your souls if you won't save your own? Some are walking, some are talking, some are stalking and kill You got social security, but it doesn't pay your bills There are addictions to feed and there are mouths to pay So we bargain with the devil, so evil, careful do they say That you love them take your money and run Say it's been swell, sweetheart, but it was just one of those things Those flings, those strings you've got to cut So get out on the streets, girls, and bust your butts Who will save your soul when it comes to the flowers now Huh huh who will save your soul after all the lies that you told, boy And who will save your soul if you won't save your own?

  Must have been late after noon I could tell by how far the child's shadow stretched out And he walked with a purpose in his sneakers down the street He had many questions like children often do He said, "Tell me all your thoughts on God And tell me, am I very far?" Must have been late after noon On our way, the sun broke free of the clouds We count only blue cars skip the cracks in the street And ask many questions like children often do We said, "Tell me all your thoughts on God 'Cause I'd really like to meet her. And ask her why we're who we are." Tell me all your thoughts on God 'Cause I'm on my way to see her So tell me, am I very far Am I very far now It's getting cold, picked up the pace How our shoes make hard noises in this place Our clothes are stained, we pass many cross eyed people And ask many questions like children often do We said, Tell me all your thoughts on God 'Cause I'd really like to meet her And ask her why we're who we are Tell me all your thoughts on God 'Cause I'm on my way to see her So tell me am I very far Am I very far now? Tell me all your thoughts on God Tell me all your thoughts on God 
  I want you to know, that I am happy for you I wish nothing but the best for you both An older version of me Is she perverted like me? Would she go down on you in a theater? Does she speak eloquently And would she have your baby? I'm sure she'd make a really excellent mother 'Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you To be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me You'd hold me until you died 'Til you died, but you're still alive And I'm here, to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair, to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know You seem very well, things look peaceful I'm not quite as well, I thought you should know Did you forget about me, Mr. Duplicity? I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner It was a slap in the face How quickly I was replaced And are you thinking of me when you fuck her? 'Cause the love that you gave that we made Wasn't able to make it enough for you To be open wide, no And every time you speak her name Does she know how you told me You'd hold me until you died 'Til you died, but you're still alive And I'm here, to remind you Of the mess you left when you went away It's not fair, to deny me Of the cross I bear that you gave to me You, you, you oughta know 'Cause the joke that you laid in the bed That was me and I'm not gonna fade As soon as you close your eyes, and you know it And every time I scratch my nails Down someone else's back I hope you feel it Well, can you feel it?

  Well, an old man said to me in a voice filled with pain, "Where you going young man?" Said I'm going to fight a war, gonna fight for my country in some foreign land. He said,"The sun will never hurt you, never harmed anyone, but you must realize if you try to stare her down, she will win in the end. She will burn your eyes, she will burn them." Seen a million places, seen a million faces die. and I wonder who will walk with me when I get to Heaven. He said, "Boy, I was young once, yeah, I was tough, sailing on Uncle Sam's boat. Hey, I could kill the enemy, I could die on foreign streets, but I could not vote. But now you walk by me, you won't talk to me, say this is my fate. But ev'ry time you walk the streets, boy, most of them you meet. You see it's you they hate, it's you, yeah." Seen a million faces, seen a million places die. and I wonder who will walk with me when I get to Heaven. I've seen a million places, seen a million faces die. and I wonder who will walk with me when I get there. See this woman sitting next to me, she's been there for a long, long time. And when I fell, she picked me up; when I cried, she wiped my tears. I thank God she's mine. And when I leave this world, she won't have anything but her love for me. 'Cause the man took ev'rything else, made me hate myself, so just let her be, boy. Won't you let her be? Seen a million places, seen a million faces die. I've seen a million mothers cry, I've seen a billion brothers dying, but I wonder who will walk with me when I get there, when I get to heaven, when I get there, when I get to Heaven. 
  I belong, a long way from here I put on a poncho and played for mosquitoes And drank 'till I was thirsty again We went searching, through thrift store jungles Found Geronimo's rifle, Marilyn's shampoo And Benny Goodman's cursive pen Well, okay, I made this up I promise you I'd never give up If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad? Get down, real low down You listen to Coltrane, derail your own train Well, who hasn't been there before? I come 'round, around the hard way Bring you comics in bed Scrape the mold off the bread And serve you french toast again Okay, I still get stoned I'm not the kind of girl you'd take home If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad? If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad? We've been far, far away from here I put on a poncho and played for mosquitoes And everywhere in between Well, okay, we get along So what if right now, everything's wrong? If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad? If it makes you happy It can't be that bad If it makes you happy Then why the hell are you so sad? 
  It felt like Springtime on this February morning In a courtyard birds were singing your praise I'm still recalling things you said to make me feel All right I carry them with me today now As I lay me down to sleep this I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky, and I will wake up happy I wonder why I feel so high, though I am not above the sorrow Heavy-hearted till you call my name and it sounds like church bells Or the whistle of a train on a Summer evening I want to meet you barefoot, barely breathing As I lay me down to sleep this I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky, and I will wake up happy (Hold out this hand) as I lay me down to sleep this I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky, and I will wake up happy It's not too near for me, like a flower I need the rain Thought it's not clear to me every season has its change And I will see you when the sun comes out again As I lay me down to sleep this I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky, and I will wake up happy Oh, only as I lay me down to sleep this I pray That you will hold me dear Though I'm far away I'll whisper your name Into the sky, and I will wake up happy I wonder why When the sun comes out again When the sun comes out again When the sun comes out again When the sun comes out Oh, when the sun comes out again When the sun comes out again Ooh, ooh, comes out, comes out Oh, wake up happy 'Cause I pray Comes out, here we go again Ooh, here we go again, baby 
  be	-Boy, where the fuck you at? I been looking for you're ass since a quarter past. Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper. Before I make you suffer That's when you had enough-a Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot? Surely I can, if you the man. I get loose and produce large amounts of juice. Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy to enter me ang get it on. You're gettin' warm. I can feel you getting closer. Now baby, down this Mimosa. You better believe it's time to give a toast to. The woman of the decade, too bad to be played. Get vex and I'm bound to throw shade. All over your body. Who's body? You're body. I can rock a party like nobody. Leavin' time to take home the loot. Choosy about who I let knock my boots. Now let me take sight while your lovin' the Lyte. Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right. CHORUS: Keep On' Keepin On, Cause you came and you changed my world. Your love so brand new. Keep on keep kickin' on. Doin it right, right, right... Ah, ah, ah.... Beware of the stare when I step into peace. I come in peace but I got shit that need to be released. Now who from the chosen shall I choose? Yeah, now you wish you was in his shoes. I found me a new nigga this year. That know's how to handle this here. Now I look forward to goin' home at night. Brother does mo right. Under the candlelight. Wax upon my back, can I handle all of that? I guess I can. Can I, why not? If I want to guess I can. Can I? More honey than a bumble-bee hive. Pulling 69 ways in my archive. Sweet like licorice. Sugar for my booga. Juicy like Hi-C. Or an Icee. I got shit to make your ass write a bad check. Cause like I said I ain't afraid of the sweat. Beat on my drum if you feel the need to. As I proceed to Open up and feed you. I got a longing to put you where you want to be. Been I can, I get rid of all company. CHORUS Many have tried strict regulation. Lazy motherfuckers get put on probation. Those that didn't perform well. They gets no answer when they ring-a-ring-a my bell. You're playing with my time. Trying to jerk me hurt me then dessert me. You better work me. While you got the oppurtunity. To be in the midst of the L-why-T-E. Only the strong survive. Only the wise excel. Once said by my born-in-hell. Only the lonely die slowly. Left all alone try to control me. Easy does it never ask how was it. Never speak my info why my sheets in the streets. Cause that ain't cool. And that ain't cute. To talk about who knocked the boots on a video shoot. But it's all good, though you gotta get it when you want it. Like your prey, make your move and hop up on it. It's natural. Never be ashamed. Fuck the fame. Get the name, and kick the game.
