  A lonely mother gazing out of her window Staring at a son that she just can't touch. If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side, But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much. But all the praying just ain't helping at all, 'Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble. So, he goes out and he makes his money the best way he know how, Another body laying cold in the gutter. Listen to me. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, But I think you're moving too fast. Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation, But he just can't see. She give him loving that his body can't handle, But all he can say is, "Baby, it's good to me." One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror, But he doesn't recognize his own face. His health is fading and he doesn't know why. Three letters took him to his final resting place. Y'all don't hear me. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, But I think you're moving too fast. I seen rainbow yesterday But too many storms have come and gone Leavin' a trace of not on God-given ray Is it because my life is ten shades of gray I pray all ten fade away Seldom praise Him for the sunny days And like his promise is true Only my faith can undo The many chances I blew To bring my life to anew Clear blue and unconditional skies Have dried the tears from my eyes No more lonely cries My only bleedin' hope Is for the folk who can't cope Wit such an endurin' pain That it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain Who's to blame For tootin' caine in your own vein What a shame You shoot and aim for someone else's brain You claim the insane And name this day in time For fallin prey to crime I say the system got you victim to your own mind Dreams are hopeless aspirations In hopes of comin' true Believe in yourself The rest is up to me and you Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, But I think you're moving too fast. Don't go chasing waterfalls. Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to. I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all, But I think you're moving too fast.

Well, I've walked these streets In a spectacle of wealth and poverty In the diamond markets the scarlet welcome carpet That they just rolled out for me And I've walked these streets In the madhouse asylum they can be Where a wild-eyed misfit prophet On a traffic island stopped and he raved of saving me Have I been blind, have I been lost Inside myself and my own mind Hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have seen Have I been wrong, have I been wise To shut my eyes and play along Hypnotized, paralyzed by what my eyes have found By what my eyes have seen What they have seen? Have I been blind Have I been lost Have I been wrong Have I been wise Have I been strong Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have found In that great street carnival Have I been blind Have I been lost Have I been wrong Have I been wise Have I been strong Have I been hypnotized, mesmerized by what my eyes have found In that great street carnival In that carnival

  You and I in this moment, Holding the night so close, Hanging on, still unbroken while outside the thunder rolls. Listen now you can her my heart beat warm against life's bitter cold. These are the days. the sweetest days we'll know. There are times that scare me. We'll rattle the house like the wind, both of us so unbending. We battle the fear within. All the while life is rushing by us. Hold it now and don't let go. These are the days. the sweetest days we'll know. So, we'll whisper a dream here in the darkness. Watching the stars till their gone. And when even the mem'ries have all faded away, these days go on and on. Listen now, you can hear my heartbeat. Hold me now and don't let go. (These are the days,) ev'ry day is the sweetest day we'll know. (These are the days,)
